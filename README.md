# 🏦 ATM System Using OOP (Python)

## Description

This project is based on an old bank program from a previous homework.
The original version only had basic banking functions.

For this assignment, I reused that code and added more classes, features, and improvements. The program now supports different account types and more operations similar to a simple ATM system.

## Features

* Create a bank account with name, secret number, and balance
* Check balance using secret number
* Deposit money into your account
* Withdraw money with secret number
* Transfer money to another account
* Pay services such as electricity or water bills
* Support for multiple account types using classes

---

## Programming Concepts Used

* Python 3
* Classes and Objects
* Inheritance
* Use of `super()` for parent class methods
* Use of `isinstance()` for account type checking
* Private attributes (`__balance`, `__secret`) for security
* Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
* Loops (`while True`) for menu interaction
* Control statements (`continue`, `break`)
* User input (`input()`) for terminal program

## How to Run

1. Open terminal
2. Go to the project folder
3. Run:

```bash
python homework/hw.py
```

## Note

This is a simple console-based program for learning purposes only.
It does not connect to any real bank system and data will not be saved after the program stops.
